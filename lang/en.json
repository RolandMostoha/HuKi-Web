  "faq_offline_title": "Is there an offline mode?",
  "faq_offline_desc": "It has a cache based offline mode. Every loaded map tile is placed in a 14-day database that can be used offline. In my experience, this method covers most cases: in the parking lot or during a hike, there is almost always enough internet to download the necessary tiles, so we don't even notice momentary interruptions.",
  "faq_full_offline_title": "Will there be a full-offline mode with a pre-downloadable map?",
  "faq_full_offline_desc": "Many of you have asked for this, so it is definitely a priority. With the current raster rendering engine, this would not be very efficient, as it would require downloading several GB of data for the entire map of Hungary. I am considering several solutions, such as smaller area-based downloads or using a vector rendering engine.",
